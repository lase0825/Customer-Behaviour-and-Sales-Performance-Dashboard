## 📊 Project Summary

This dashboard analyzes customer purchase behavior using key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations to understand sales trends, revenue generation, customer loyalty, and satisfaction levels.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel**  
- **Power Query** (for data cleaning & transformation)
- **PivotTables & PivotCharts** (for dynamic visuals)
- **Slicers & Filters** (for interactivity)

---

## 📁 Dataset Source

- The data used was sourced from **Kaggle**
- Fields included: Customer ID, Age, Gender, Join Date, Payment Method, Loyalty Status, Total Purchase, Discounts, Product Category, Shipping Cost, Experience Rating, etc.

---

## 🧠 Key Metrics Visualized

- **Sales by Month**
- **Revenue by Year**
- **Sales by Category**
- **Customer Payment Method**

## 🔄 Data Preparation Process

1. **Imported Raw Data** into Power Query.
2. **Cleaned**:
   - Converted date formats and currency values.
   - Replaced missing/null values.
   - Mapped numeric experience ratings to text (e.g., 1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent).
3. **Transformed**:
   - Created new columns for year, month, and age groups.
   - Parsed and standardized payment methods and product categories.
4. **Loaded** the transformed data back to Excel for dashboard creation.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

- **No Quantity Data**: Couldn’t compute profit margins or unit sales; focused analysis on revenue-based KPIs.
- **Experience Rating Conversion**: Mapping numeric to qualitative values (e.g., “Neutral”, “Excellent”) required logic building.
- **Currency Formatting**: Ensured consistency in currency formatting across all fields for accurate visualization.

---

## 📌 Insights Discovered

- Customers aged **21–40** were the biggest contributors to sales.
- **E-Wallets** and **Credit Cards** were the most used payment methods.
- The top-performing categories were **Beauty**, **Music**, and **Health**.
- Majority of customers reported **Fair** or **Poor** experience, highlighting areas for service improvement.
